Course Project Proposal COMP 4750 - Introduction to Natural Language Processing (Fall 2025) Name: Girish Verma Email: gverma@mun.ca Student ID: 202157608 Title: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews Using Supervised Machine Learning Proposal Text Understanding public sentiment through text is an increasingly important challenge in computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP). One particularly engaging domain is movie reviews, where subjective opinions are plentiful and easily accessible. This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis system that can classify movie reviews based on their associated star ratings, thereby inferring the emotional valence of the text. The motivation behind this work stems from the growing influence of user-generated content in shaping consumer behavior, as well as the academic interest in how language reflects opinion (Pang & Lee, 2008). Furthermore, the challenge of interpreting nuanced and sometimes ambiguous expressions makes this a compelling problem for testing models that combine morphology, syntax, and semantics. Sentiment analysis has been a key task in NLP for over two decades. Early work focused on binary classification (positive vs. negative), with datasets like the IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Letterboxd reviews forming the backbone of benchmark comparisons (Pang et al., 2002; Maas et al., 2011). More recent efforts have included fine-grained sentiment classification and deep learning techniques (Socher et al., 2013), while maintaining classical machine learning pipelines such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines as strong baselines. Tools like the Stanford CoreNLP suite or NLTK have also played a pivotal role in preprocessing and linguistic feature extraction. However, one challenge noted in several studies is the difficulty of evaluating models on subjective data due to label noise and dataset biases. The concept of a “gold standard” dataset, where labels are drawn directly from human-curated metadata, such as star ratings, offers a practical solution to ensure reliable model training and evaluation (Kim, 2014). This project will use a supervised learning approach to build a sentiment classifier for movie reviews, using star ratings as ground-truth labels and review text as training input. The dataset will be collected from publicly available sources such as IMDb, Kaggle or Letterboxd, focusing on balanced subsets to avoid class skew. The project will explore traditional classifiers like logistic regression and SVMs, as well as a basic neural network, with performance evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Preprocessing will involve standard NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and possibly the use of morphological analyzers to explore whether linguistic structure aids classification. The scope will remain moderate: the system will be trained on a subset (e.g., 10,000–50,000 reviews) to ensure feasibility while being large enough to allow meaningful evaluation. References 1.
